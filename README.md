# Rough Plan

1. Create Dev branch and npm i
2. Find API and check with postman if it is an API worth working with
3. Create file architecture. Start with the files I know I will need. Put dummy code in each file, so app doesn't break right away.
4. Make an API fetch call to bring data into the app.
5. Set up BrowserRouter, Routes, and Switch (maybe make switch in an external function?). Link files together.
6. Map data and create a list of data.
7. Create a detail view (useParams or useLocation)
